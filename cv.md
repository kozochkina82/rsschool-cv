## About me
Hello, my name is Nadezhda, I'm 41 years old.
I started to learn coding this year. I have finished the Stage 0 of RS School JavaScript course, and now I'm trying to learn more.
In the past, I've had different work expirience. I learned psychology, I have my own practice, and also I write articles. My second education was an ecology engineer, and I worked for some years as an ecology projects developer.
I love to learn programming, becouse it is very interesting, and also it's a kind of challenge for me. 

My goal is to become a JS&Frontend junior as soon as possible, becouse I moved from Russia and I need to got a different profession to work abroad. 
Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to learn, becouse I work a lot, but I don't give up and I'm trying again and again.
